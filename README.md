SQL 50 Challenge – My Solutions

This repo has my solutions for the LeetCode SQL 50 problems.
I solved them step by step, tested them, and added clean SQL queries for each one.

How to Use

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sql-50-challenge.git


Open any .sql file

Run it on your own DB (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server – most queries are standard)

Notes

Queries are short and readable

Some problems include comments to explain my thinking

Focused on clear logic instead of fancy tricks

If there’s more than one way, I usually pick the cleanest one

Next Steps

Keep improving queries with better performance

Add explanations for tricky ones

Maybe record walkthroughs later

Always happy to learn new tricks.
